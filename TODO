1.0 plan:

- StatusBar Message of ending extraction
- Check overwrite
? Port akuViewer to KParts (?? troubles in handling a non-existing file ?? maybe akuViewer is better)
- Clean dragTarget's code
- Sum of packed size in meta
- Where possible use QHBoxLayout and QVBoxLayout in place of QGridLayout
- Check overwritedialog's resize policy
- Check overwritedialog's reactivity slowness
? Make restriction handling in a separate thread
- Check wait cursor
? Reopening an archive is slooooow
- toLong() to toULong()
- Make const unedited params in functions
/ fix percentage parsing
/ issue when reloading archive after encryption
? "Encrypt this archive" -> "Encrypt this archive's header"
/ Adding files to header protected ones does not work (goes loop)
/ Archive creation doesn't stop
- Sending aku to tray during archive creation still keeps visible the creation dialog
- Erase akuShadeAnimation. REASON: completely unuseful!
- When canceling archive creation: "Archive creation stopped. Do you wish to erase the archive?"


next features plan:

- Column ordering, see Dolphin for tips
- Move lots of code from mainwindow to specific classes
- Make comments in english
- Archive creation: dragging many files at same time
